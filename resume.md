- Drive open source efforts around Luau (reaching consensus, code sanitization and release, establishing processes, engaging with community)
- Improve internal engine technology and satellite projects through review and mentorship
- Technical guidance for all internal projects that involve or interface with "native" (C++) stack
- Influence the state of graphics hardware/APIs through advisory panels/boards (Intel Visual Computing ARB, Vulkan Advisory Panel)
- Contribute to open standards such as WebAssembly (SIMD) and glTF (quantization, compression)

### Roblox - Technical Director (April 2014 - March 2019)

- Guide internal projects that involve the native (C++) stack: design review, code review, mentoring, hiring, middleware evaluation, performance analysis and recommendations, etc. etc.
- Improve network bandwidth by optimizing gameplay and physics data (general-purpose compression, repacking data for better compression, redesigned GUID replication, custom packed physics transform compressors)
- Implement always-enabled memory and performance profiling systems for internal and external use (category-based memory tracking, instrumentation based profiling based on open-source but *very* substantially improved microprofile library)
- Define direction for future Roblox lighting engine by implementing various prototypes and guiding the team in shipping the results (Forward+ with tiled shadow maps, custom GPU-based voxel system, HDR, physically based BRDFs)
- Implement multi-API shader recompilation system to reduce shader maintenance (single source of truth, offline shader optimization passes, custom SPIRV transform pipelines for Vulkan)
- Extend rendering backend to support Metal and Vulkan (also persevere through myriads of Android issues and ship support for Vulkan on Android 7.x and above)
- Implement new voxel terrain system (custom pseudo dual contouring mesher, rendering/physics/networking/storage support, cache efficient KDTree for physics, level of detail support, fast navigation data rasterizer, in-memory hyper compressed format, screen space reflections, material blending, detiling, miscellaneous shader work)
- Implement VR support in Roblox engine (OpenVR/libOVR, stereo rendering optimizations, custom tracking, prediction and reprojection support for Google Cardboard)
- Implement custom Lua parsing and linting framework, used to detect likely issues in script code and as foundation for autocomplete
- Implement efficient character shadows for low-end mobile platforms (prefiltered shadowmaps with 8-bit depth, optimized for small number of casters)

### Roblox - Senior Rendering Engineer (August 2012 - March 2014)

- Worked on porting ROBLOX client to iOS (performance/memory optimization, OpenGL ES2 support, improving stability, etc.)
- Developed an adaptive rendering system that optimizes user-generated content on the fly to balance CPU/GPU usage (automatic static and dynamic geometry batching, character texture compositing, material and batch LOD)
- Developed a custom compressed binary format optimized for specific ROBLOX needs to significantly improve load/save times (generic DOM serialization with special packing to optimize for loading efficiency and compression ratio with transparent versioning/compatibility)
- Developed a novel approach to lighting the environment using CPU-based voxel computations (sun shadows, sky occlusion, local point/spot lights with shadow support, SSE2/NEON optimizations)
- Optimized client and server for performance, memory and load times (clientside CPU and GPU optimizations for a wide range of hardware, significant reduction of render farm size)
- Rewritten the low level rendering engine from scratch, replacing Ogre3D with an in-house solution (significantly improved performance and load times, 10x less code to maintain; D3D9/GL/GLES2)
